#Short caption: SPHERE: 5 sigma post-processed [SDI] contrast curve for an ~1hr observation of Sirius. It is a combination of IFS YJH-band (<0.7”) and IRDIS K-band (>0.7”) contrast curves. (source: Vigan, et al. (2015))
#Full description: SPHERE 5 sigma contrast curve from observations of Sirius. At separations <0.7" the curve is for IFS YJH, while >0.7” is IRDIS K12; 0.7” is the crossover point where IRDIS becomes better than IFS. Integration times: IRDIS = 88 min, IFS = 59min; difference is due to detector overheads. FOV rotation = 106dgr. The SDI reduction assumes the planet-star contrast is constant at all wavelengths.
