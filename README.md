# CGI-flux-ratio-plot
This contains the python code to plot the flux ratio vs separation plot. It also contains the text files with the contrast curves and planet contrast values. Each datafile has a full description of its comment section; a short caption is auto-generated by the script from these headers.

## Plot options
To customize what is plotted, you can manually set various options at the contrast_plot.py.

Available WFIRST modes:
* planet imaging BTR
* disk mask BTR
* disk mask prediction

Available instruments:
* GPI IFS
* SPHERE: IFS & IRDIS
* HST NICMOS
* HST STIS
* JWST NIRCam

Available planets:
* known self-luminious directly imaged planets: measured H-band contrasts & extrapolations for WFIRST bands.
* known RV planets: extrapolated reflected light brightness (needs verified)
* Earth & Jupiter (needs verified)
* Proxima Cen b estimate (needs verified)

Available plotting options:
* color coding by bandpass

## Data file format
Datafiles should be formatted in the following way to allow for auto import by astropy.io.ascii & auto generation of caption.txt:

#col_name1  col_name2
#Short caption: _Write a short explanation, suitable for a figure caption. This line is automatically fed into "caption.txt" when contrast_plot.py is run. This line must begin with the phrase "short caption:" & be all on one line (ie: no "return" characters)._
#Full explanation: _Write any/all details needed to understand this dataset. This line is not included in caption.txt._
#References
#URLs or paper references or other source information
