# CGI-flux-ratio-plot
This contains the python code to plot the flux ratio vs separation plot. It also contains the text files with the contrast curves and planet contrast values. Each datafile has a full description of its comment section; a brief explanation (auto_caption.txt) is auto-generated by the script from these headers, including only those data you choose plot.

## Plot options
To customize what is plotted, you can manually set various options at the contrast_plot.py.

Available WFIRST modes:
* planet imaging BTR
* disk imaging BTR
* HLC & SPC disk mask predictions

Available instruments:
* Gemini GPI IFS
* VLT SPHERE: IFS & IRDIS
* HST ACS
* HST NICMOS
* HST STIS
* JWST NIRCam

Available planets:
* known self-luminious directly imaged planets: measured H-band contrasts & extrapolations.
* known RV planets: extrapolated reflected light brightness
* Earth & Jupiter at 10pc
* Tau Ceti e & f

Available plotting options:
* color coding by bandpass

## Data file format
Datafiles should be formatted in the following way to allow for auto import by astropy.io.ascii & auto generation of caption.txt:
```
#col_name1  col_name2
#Short caption: Write a short explanation, suitable for a figure caption. This line is automatically fed into "auto_caption.txt" when contrast_plot.py is run. This line must begin with the phrase "short caption:" & be all on one line (ie: no "return" characters).
#Full explanation: Optional. Any other info that you don't want to appear in auto_caption.
#References
#URLs or paper references or other source information
data11  data12
data21	data22
...
```
## Data description
As mentioned above, "auto_caption.txt" contains a description of each quantity you choose to plot.

Below is a suggested figure caption; however, because this is NOT automatically generated by the scipt, please check to make sure it matches the information in "auto_caption" and is appropriate for the plot options you have chosen.

WFIRST performance in context of known planets and existing and planned high-contrast instruments.
The y-axis is contrast: either the flux ratio between a planet and its star (for individual planets) or the flux ratio between the noise floor and star (for instrument performance curves).
The lower x-axis is projected separation in arcseconds, and the upper x-axis is the corresponding physical separation for the Tau Ceti system.
Points and lines are color-coded by wavelength of observation.
Solid and dashed lines are 5-sigma post-processed contrast curves, labeled by instrument.
Contrast curves for future observatories JWST (predicted) and HabEx (goal) are plotted as dashed lines.
Lines labeled BTR# are WFIRST Baseline Technical Requirements.
Black triangular points are estimated reflected light contrast ratios for known gas giant radial velocity-detected (RV) planets at quadrature, with assumed geometric albedo of 0.5.
Red squares are H-band contrasts of known self-luminous directly-imaged (DI) planets.
Dotted lines connect each DI planetâ€™s known H-band contrast to its predicted contrast at 750nm (yellow diamonds) or 550nm (blue circles), based on COND or BT-Settl planet evolutionary models.
Cyan points represent the Earth and Jupiter at 10pc as well as super-Earths Tau Ceti e and f; refer to the upper x-axis for corresponding physical separation.
