#Rho(as) Band4_pt_contr_snr5
#Short caption: WFIRST extended source BTR: [TECH 3] WFIRST shall be able to measure the extended surface brightness around a star as faint as V=5 with an SNR of 10 within 24 hours (TBR) of integration time on the target in CGI Band 4. It shall be able to make this measurement for an extended source with an integrated surface brightness per resolution element equivalent to a source-to-star flux ratio as faint as 5e-8 (TBR) at a separation between 0.54 and 1.36 arcsec and as faint as 1e-7 (TBR) at a separation between 0.47 and 1.44 arcsec.
