#Short caption: *OBSOLETE* CGI spectroscopy L2 [TECH 2]. Removed from MRD Feb. 2020, but kept here for historical completeness. "WFIRST CGI shall be able to measure spectra of an astrophysical point source with R = 50 or greater spectral resolution with a wavelength accuracy of 2 nm or smaller to an SNR of 10 within 100 hours of integration time on the target in CGI Filter Band 3 for an object with a source-to-star flux ratio as faint as 1e-7 at separations from 0.20 arcsec to 0.26 arscec, 5e-8 at separations from 0.26 arcsec to 0.51 arcsec, and 1e-7 at separations from 0.51 arcsec to 0.57 arcsec."
