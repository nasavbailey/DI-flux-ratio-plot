#Short caption: WFIRST CGI spectroscopy L2 [TECH 2]: WFIRST CGI shall be able to measure spectra of an astrophysical point source with R = 50 or greater spectral resolution with a wavelength accuracy of 5 nm or smaller (TBR) to an SNR of 10 within 100 hours of integration time on the target in CGI Filter Band 3 for an object with a source-to-star flux ratio as faint as 1e-7 at separations from 0.21 arcsec to 0.27 arscec, 5e-8 at separations from 0.27 arcsec to 0.53 arcsec, and 1e-7 at separations from 0.53 arcsec to 0.60 arcsec.
