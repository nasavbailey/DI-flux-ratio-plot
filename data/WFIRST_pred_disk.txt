#Short caption: WFIRST CGI disk imaging prediction: **pre-WIETR** L3 post-processed sensitivity requirement for Band 3 imaging with the SPC "disk" mask. The new baseline configuration pairs the SPC disk mask with Band 4, rather than Band 3; it is assumed that the flux ratio requirements as well as the IWA and OWA in units of lambda/D remain the same.
