#name	547m_delta	763m_delta	H_delta	Rho(as)	PA#short caption: DI: Selected known self-luminous Directly Imaged (DI) exoplanets with known H-band contrasts. Predicted fluxes at ~750nm and ~550nm are derived from either COND (Teff<=1200K) or BT-SETTL models. For expediency WFC3 filters that approximate WFIRST bands were used (547nm 10% and 763nm 10%), because WFC3 colors are already provided with the model grids.
