#Short caption: Roman CGI L1 requirement (TTR5): Roman shall be able to measure (using CGI), with SNR >= 5, the brightness of an astrophysical point source located between 6 and 9 lambda/D from an adjacent star with a VAB magnitude <= 5, with a flux ratio >= 1·10^-7; the bandpass shall have a central wavelength <= 600 nm and a bandwidth >= 10%.
